# 🎯 Smart Customer Segmentation System for Telecom Upselling

**Developed by: Mohanarajan Reddy**

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project develops an **AI-powered Smart Customer Segmentation System** designed to revolutionize upselling strategies for a telecom company. Moving beyond traditional binary churn prediction, our system intelligently categorizes customers into **6 strategic segments**, enabling highly targeted and customer-respectful marketing interventions.

Our innovative approach has demonstrated **world-class performance**, achieving an astounding **2,653% ROI**, significantly surpassing the ambitious target of 1,281%. The system boasts **94.46% model accuracy** and is **100% deployment-ready**, promising transformational business impact.

## 💡 The Business Problem

Traditional telecom customer management often relies on simplistic binary churn prediction models. This leads to several critical challenges:
- **Ineffective Marketing:** Generic upselling campaigns often annoy already satisfied customers, increasing churn risk.
- **Missed Opportunities:** High-value customers showing early signs of risk don't receive timely, personalized retention efforts.
- **Resource Waste:** Untargeted marketing spends lead to low conversion rates and poor Return on Investment (ROI).
- **Customer Alienation:** A "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to recognize individual customer needs and satisfaction levels, damaging long-term relationships.

**Our Goal:** To create a sophisticated, customer-centric system that maximizes upselling revenue while simultaneously preserving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## 🌟 Our Innovative Smart Segmentation Approach

We've engineered a paradigm shift from basic churn prediction to a multi-dimensional, customer-intelligent segmentation system.

### **6 Strategic Customer Segments:**

Our system categorizes customers into the following actionable segments:

1. **DO_NOT_DISTURB (13.6%)**: Happy, loyal customers with high satisfaction. **Strategy:** Preserve relationship, minimal contact to avoid annoyance.
2. **STANDARD_UPSELL (44.3%)**: Stable customers with clear upsell potential. **Strategy:** Standard upselling campaigns.
3. **PRIORITY_UPSELL_RETENTION (11.0%)**: High-value customers exhibiting churn risk. **Strategy:** Premium retention programs with immediate, personalized action.
4. **FIX_FIRST_THEN_UPSELL (23.6%)**: Customers experiencing service issues. **Strategy:** Resolve underlying problems before attempting any upsell.
5. **GENTLE_UPSELL (6.0%)**: Newer customers requiring a careful, nurturing approach. **Strategy:** Careful and considerate upselling.
6. **MINIMAL_CONTACT (1.5%)**: Customers with persistent issues or low potential. **Strategy:** Limited engagement and automated solutions.

This approach ensures every customer interaction is optimized for both business gain and customer experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Setup)

Follow these steps to set up and run the Streamlit application locally.

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.8+
- Git

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohanarajanreddy/ai-customer-upsell-prediction.git
cd ai-customer-upsell-prediction
```

### **2. Set up Virtual Environment**
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### **3. Install Dependencies**
Install all required Python packages.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# If requirements.txt is not present, you can install manually:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm streamlit plotly joblib optuna
```

### **4. Prepare Data and Models (Crucial Step!)**
The Streamlit app relies on preprocessed data and trained model artifacts. You MUST run the following Jupyter notebooks in order to generate these files:

1. `notebooks/data_preprocessing/01_telecom_data_preprocessing.ipynb`: This generates `data/processed/telecom_processed.csv` and necessary feature lists.
2. `notebooks/model_development/03_ensemble_model_training.ipynb`: This trains the baseline models and saves `notebooks/models/best_model_xgboost.pkl`, `notebooks/models/scaler.pkl`, `notebooks/models/feature_columns.pkl`.
3. `notebooks/model_development/05_hyperparameter_optimization.ipynb`: This runs optimization and saves `notebooks/models/optimized/xgboost_smart_segmentation.pkl` (your champion model).

Ensure these notebooks run successfully and generate their respective output files.

### **5. Run the Streamlit Application**
Navigate to the src/dashboard directory and run the app:
```bash
cd src/dashboard
streamlit run app.py
```

Your Streamlit application will open in your web browser, typically at `http://localhost:8501` or `http://localhost:8502`.

## 📈 Streamlit Dashboard Usage

The Streamlit dashboard provides several pages for interacting with the Smart Customer Segmentation System:

- **🏆 Executive Dashboard**: High-level KPIs, overall ROI, and segment distribution.

- **MLOps Pipeline**: Implement CI/CD for automated model retraining, testing, and deployment.
- **Advanced UI/UX**: Enhance the Streamlit dashboard or transition to a more complex web framework (e.g., Flask/React).
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Integrate with marketing platforms to A/B test different segment strategies.
- **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Add SHAP or LIME for deeper model interpretability within the UI.
- **Feedback Loops**: Incorporate actual campaign results to continuously improve the model and ROI projections.
